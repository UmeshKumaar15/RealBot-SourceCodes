# RealBot-SourceCodes

This project showcases a web-controlled car system built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and the L298N motor driver. The car can be controlled remotely with many electronic devices (Laptops, phones, tablets, etc.) through a web server created with Flask, providing a user-friendly interface. The project incorporates HTML and CSS for designing an appealing webpage, enabling users to send commands to the Raspberry Pi, which in turn communicates with the Arduino to control the car's movement.
